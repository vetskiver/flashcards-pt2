# Flashcards Part 1

## Description
Flashcards Part 1 is a web application designed to display and manage flashcards for various information sets. The application showcases a single card at a time, revealing different components of a paired information set. Users can interact with the flashcards to flip them and view the corresponding information, and navigate through the cards using a "Next" button.

## Features

### Required Features
- **Card Set Display:** Shows the title of the card set along with a short description and the total number of cards.
- **Single Card Display:** Only one card is displayed at a time, showing one component of the information pair.
- **Card Pair List:** The application manages a list of card pairs, where each pair contains a question and an answer.
- **Card Interaction:**
  - **Click to Flip:** Clicking on a card reveals the corresponding component of the information pair.
  - **Next Button:** Clicking the "Next" button displays a new card from the set at random.

### Stretch Features
- **Visual Styles:** Cards feature different visual styles based on their category. Categories include:
  - Difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard

## Technologies Used
- **React:** For building the user interface and managing state.
- **HTML/CSS:** For structuring and styling the application.
- **JavaScript:** For handling user interactions and dynamic content updates.

## How It Works
1. **Card Set Overview:** The application presents the title and description of the card set along with the total number of cards available.
2. **View Cards:** Users see one card at a time, which displays one component of the paired information (either the question or the answer).
3. **Card Interaction:** Clicking on a card flips it to reveal the other component of the information pair.
4. **Navigation:** Users can click the "Next" button to view a random new card from the set.
